# amirtha-portfolio
A personal portfolio made with HTML and CSS. 


## Summary :bookmark:

##### To create my portfolio I have used html and css. I have used vscode as the programming platform to make my portfolio. In my website I have created a responsive nav-bar that links to different elements on my page. Also, I have created a content page that links to three different section elements on the page. I have added semantic html and ensured that all a-tags are functioning. When you open my page you should find that the the first project is larger than the other projects on the page. 

## About Me :microscope:

##### I am working currently as a Healthcare Support Worker Apprentice in Birmingham. I have always loved computers, and it has been a fascination of mine for life; I finally decided to explore my adoration for coding by starting. :nerd_face: :grin: I am passionate about teaching, and I hope that my GitHub repositories will show the expanse of all the knowledge that I can use to educate others.
